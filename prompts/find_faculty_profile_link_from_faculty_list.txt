Extract the faculty profile address from the following HTML content. Only return the information in the format of a list of dicts that they have keys "name", "profile_address", "position", "department", "university" and "research domain". For the "profile_address", you would need to return the full url, which sometimes is not complete in this html and you might want to merge the base profile url with it: [profile_base_url]. Do not include any other text. Here is the HTML content:\n\n[html_content]\n\n
For example:

{
  "name": "Jeff",
  "profile_address": "https://www.yale/jeff.com",
  "position": "Assistant Professor",
  "department": "Biology",
  "university": "Yale",
  "research domain": "Gene analysis, Personalized medicine"
}

Return the result as a JSON object:
