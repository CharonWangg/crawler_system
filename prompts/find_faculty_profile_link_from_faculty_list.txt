Extract the faculty profile address from the following HTML content. Only return the information in the format of a list of dicts that they have keys "name", "profile_address", "position", "department", "university" and "research domain". For the "profile_address", you would need to return the full url, which sometimes is not complete in this html and you might want to merge the base profile url with it: [profile_base_url]. Also note that there might be faculties having similar names, be strict that do not mix them.
For example:

[{
  "name": "Jeff",
  "profile_address": "https://www.yale/jeff.com",
  "position": "Assistant Professor",
  "department": "Biology",
  "university": "Yale",
  "research domain": "Gene analysis, Personalized medicine"
},
{
  "name": "Jack",
  "profile_address": "https://www.yale/jack.com",
  "position": "Associate Professor",
  "department": "Biology",
  "university": "Yale",
  "research domain": "Cancer research, Personalized medicine"
}]

Here is the HTML content:
