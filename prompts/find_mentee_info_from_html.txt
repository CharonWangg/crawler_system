Extract the requested information of the web page owner from the provided HTML content. Each profile should include:

"name"
"position"
"department"
"university"
"research domain" (a sentence that includes research domain concepts/keywords)
"description" (a summarization of research direction)
"email" (convert to standard format)
"avatar" (complete URL of image/avatar)
"website" (complete URL of lab/personal website, lab website is better than personal website)
"mentor" (dictionary of names and personal website links)

If any information is missing, include the key with an empty dictionary ({}). If the HTML contains a relative path, prepend it with the base URL provided as [profile_base_url]. The mentor should at least include the provided primary mentor names and their personal website links, please add other mentors if you find more in the HTML content.

Return the result as a JSON object that has a "result" key indicating result return in the following format:
{
  "result": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "position": "Postdoc",
    "department": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering",
    "university": "UC San Diego",
    "research domain": "Computational plasma physics, Laser-plasma interactions, High energy density physics, Kinetic plasma phenomena, Numerical algorithms",
    "description": "John Doe's research focuses on light-matter interactions at extreme light intensities, examining relativistic and quantum effects.
