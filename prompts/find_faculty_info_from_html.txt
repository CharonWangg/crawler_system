Extract faculty information from the provided HTML content. Each faculty profile should include:

"name"
"position"
"department"
"university"
"research domain" (a sentence that includes research domain concepts/keywords)
"description" (a summarization of research direction)
"email" (convert to standard format)
"avatar" (complete URL of image/avatar)
"website" (complete URL of lab/personal website)
"grad students" (dictionary of names and personal website links)
"postdocs" (dictionary of names and personal website links)

If any information is missing, include the key with an empty dictionary ({}). If the HTML contains a relative path, prepend it with the base URL provided as [profile_base_url].

Return the result as a JSON object that has a "result" key indicating result return in the following format:
{
  "result": {
    "name": "Jeff",
    "position": "Assistant Professor",
    "department": "Biology",
    "university": "UCSD",
    "research domain": "Gene analysis, Evolutionary biology, Personalized medicine, Agricultural biotechnology",
    "description": "Dr. Jeff's research focuses on identifying genetic variants, profiling gene expression, and investigating functional genomics using cutting-edge technologies like Next-Generation Sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9. He aims to advance medical genomics for personalized medicine, enhance agricultural biotechnology, and deepen our understanding of evolutionary biology.",
