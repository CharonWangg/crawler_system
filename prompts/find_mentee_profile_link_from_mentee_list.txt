Extract all graduate students/postdocs profile addresses from the provided HTML content. Each profile should be represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

"name"
"profile_address" (complete URL of the profile page in the official department/university website)
"position"
"department"
"university"

Ensure the following:

- The "profile_address" must be a complete URL. If the HTML contains a relative path, prepend it with the base URL provided as [profile_base_url].
- If any information is missing for a key, include that key with an empty dictionary ({}) as its value.
- Handle faculty with similar names carefully to avoid mixing profiles. Ensure strict matching based on the provided HTML content.
- Do not omit any faculty member listed in the HTML content who has a profile address.

For incomplete URLs, concatenate the base URL with the relative path. For example, for the profile address, if the base URL is "https://www.example_university.com" and the relative path is "/phd/john-doe", the complete URL should be "https://www.example_university.com/phd/john-doe".

If certain information is not available, represent it as follows:

{
  "name": "Researcher Name",
  "profile_address": {},
  "position": "Position",
  "department": "Department",
  "university": "University",
  "research domain": {}
}

Return the result as a JSON object that has a "result" key indicating result return in the following format:
{
  "result": [
    {
      "name": "Researcher Name",
      "profile_address": "https://www.example_university/path/researcher-profile",
      "position": "Position",
      "department": "Department",
      "university": "University",
      "research domain": "Research Keywords"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
